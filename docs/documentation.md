# Task Management API - Unit Testing Documentation

## Testing Process for Task Management API

This document outlines the testing process for the Task Management API, including details on the unit test suite, coverage metrics, and automation setup.

## Test Suite Overview

The Task Management API is designed with a focus on maintainability and testability. The test suite includes unit tests across the various components of the application, ensuring that individual units of code function as expected. The tests cover key areas such as controllers, use cases, and repositories.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the project root:

```bash
go test ./... -cover
```

also you can run the following command to generate a coverage report:

```bash
go test ./... -coverprofile coverage.out
go tool cover -html coverage.out
```

## Test Coverage

The test coverage for the different components of the Task Management API is as follows:

- Controllers: Coverage: 73.5% of statements
- Infrastructure: Coverage: 88.9% of statements
- Repositories: Coverage: 78.7.1% of statements
- Use Cases: Coverage: 85.4% of statements

The overall coverage indicates that the core logic and infrastructure components are well-tested, while some areas such as controllers might require additional test cases to improve coverage.

## Test Automation

The project uses GitHub Actions for test automation. The automated pipeline runs the tests on every push to the repository, ensuring that the codebase remains stable. However, it's important to note that the repository tests are not included in the automation pipeline because the database is not mocked. These tests should be run locally to verify the repository functions.

## Local Testing for Repository

Since the repository tests interact with a real database, they are excluded from the GitHub Actions pipeline. To run these tests locally:

1. Ensure your database is up and running.
2. Execute the tests with the following command in the project root:

```bash
go test ./repositories -cover
```

This will provide a more accurate picture of the repository's behavior with actual data.

## Issues Encountered

During the testing process, a few issues were encountered:

1. Dependency on Environment Files: Some tests initially failed due to missing environment files. This was resolved by ensuring the tests were independent of environment-specific configurations.
2. Nil Pointer Dereference: There was a runtime error related to a nil pointer dereference in the use case tests. This issue was identified and fixed by ensuring that all dependencies were properly mocked before running the tests.

## Conclusion

The unit test suite for the Task Management API ensures that the core functionality is thoroughly tested. While the test coverage is strong in most areas, further efforts can be made to increase coverage, especially in the controllers. Automated testing with GitHub Actions provides continuous feedback on code quality, with local tests complementing this by covering database-dependent functionalities.

The testing process has been instrumental in identifying and resolving issues early in the development cycle, leading to a more robust and reliable application.
